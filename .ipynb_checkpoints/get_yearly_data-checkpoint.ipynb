Per game statistics are how many points, assists, minutes, etc. that player averaged per game. For these statistics, the number of minutes a player plays will heavily influence the actual numbers. Per 100 possession statistics, will not factor in the number of minutes played, but rather will extrapolate out as if each player had the same number of possessions. These are useful numbers, but can suffer due to small sample size for players who do not play a lot. Finally, advanced statistics are an amalgamation of single player statistics."
